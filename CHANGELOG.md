# GFX.Physics release notes

This log starts with 0.7.0 and covers changes since tag 0.6.0. Future changes
are recorded under `## [Unreleased]` before publication, with French authored
first in `CHANGELOG.fr.md`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-24

### Why upgrade?

This release extends application integration of physics worlds, strengthens
lifetime contracts, and fixes contacts and constraints. It also reduces
temporary copies and allocations in the solvers.

### Changes

- Physics stepping can be suspended without catch-up on resume or stale
  events; inactive ECS bodies retain their state.
- Character movement gains stop and slide responses, fixed-step hooks, and
  queries that exclude the character itself.
- Objects and snapshots can carry application identities. Completed-step
  counters and body identities are exposed; body-wide event options and
  subscription retention are strengthened.
- Compound-collider contacts remain independent. Speculative contacts,
  degenerate geometry, motor/mouse joints, and distance constraints are fixed;
  joint reactions respect their units.
- A zero-duration step is distinct from an explicit contact refresh. Retained
  handles are invalidated when the world is finalized, and invalid public
  values receive stronger checks.
- The solver borrows more body views and keeps velocities local across
  impulses. Worlds without joints skip unnecessary joint collision filtering
  and passes. Differential tests and parallel determinism traces cover more cases.

### Impact and migration

Review uses of zero-duration steps, events, handles after world destruction,
and joint observations: this release corrects their contracts, not just their
performance. Consult the relevant guides under `Docs/EN/`. Silex 0.47.0 is
recommended for recent runtime fixes and optimizations; the declared minimum
remains 0.44.0.

The [CCD allocation diagnostic](Benchmarks/Baselines/2026-09-24-native-heap.md)
measures a **compiler** improvement with an unchanged solver. Its figures do
not measure the overall gain of GFX.Physics 0.7.0 over 0.6.0.
